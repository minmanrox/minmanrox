			<div class="about_me"> Hi there! I'm Kyle Minihan and I am a junior  Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M University. 
					I am currently seeking co-op and internship opportunities for Fall 2024 and beyond.</div>
			<h2>My Story</h2>
			<div class="content_block">
				<p class="indent">
					I grew up in Northern Virginia, where I witnessed and admired the hard work and advanced technology that goes into national 
					security. This ignited a passion for security in me and set me on the path toward a career in service of my nation.
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					At Texas A&M, I have received a top-notch education and gained valuable research experience. My coursework in computer engineering 
					gives me a wide breadth of knowledge of computer systems, from the top-level software down to the binary hardware.
					My cybersecurity minor has given me skills in the fundamentals of cybersecurity. Working in the Secure and Trustworthy Hardware 
					Lab, I have gained valuable research experience while also learning the principles of security at the hardware level. My commitment
					to academic success has allowed me to maintain a 4.0 GPA while also continuing to participate in undergraduate research.
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					My experience in both academics and research has given me a diverse set of skills. Collaborative projects in both my coursework
					and research have developed my soft skills including teamwork, communication, and project management. My research experience has
					given me valuable problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. I have also developed many hard skills, including hardware simulation
					and hardware fuzzing, Git version control, Python and C/C++ programming, FPGA programming, and more.
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					My professional aspirations are guided by a sense of patriotism and a desire to protect others. A strong education in computer security
					enables me to fight against bad actors in the cyber realm. My goal is to pursue a career where I can apply these skills to protect 
					against the most advanced threats to our national and global security.
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					On this website, you can learn more about me and the projects that I have worked on. I encourage you to take a look around, and please
					feel free to contact me with any questions or opportunities. Thank you for visiting!
